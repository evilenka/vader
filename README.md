vader
=====
vader (Virtual Address DumpER) is a small command-line tool.
It represents a shell for exploring Windows Virtual Address Space.
It also includes a tool for hibernation file unpacking (hib2dump.py).
It is done for my graduation paper in Ural SU.
The code is a bit shitty, maybe I'll refactor it one day.
